# ga-hw0

Implement a deterministic and a heuristic search method.
Test and compare them using 4 benchmark functions.
You can find benchmark functions here
One of the functions should be Rastrigin's Function.
The functions should be tested using the following numbers of dimensions:
2, 5, 20.
In the case of heuristic search methods, a proper sample size (minimally 30) should be used.
Write a report detailing and explaining your motivation, method, results, and draw conclusions.
